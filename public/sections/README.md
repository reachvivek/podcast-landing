- Overall section composition
- Grid/column layouts
- Spacing between elements

✅ **Design Details**
- Colors and gradients
- Typography (sizes, weights)
- Icons and graphics
- Buttons and CTAs

✅ **Interactive States**
- Hover effects
- Active/selected states
- Expanded/collapsed (accordions)
- Animation start/end frames

✅ **Responsive Views**
- Desktop (1440px+)
- Tablet (768px-1024px)
- Mobile (375px-767px)

## Tips for Best Screenshots

1. **Full Resolution**: Take screenshots at actual size (don't zoom in/out)
2. **Clean Browser**: Hide bookmarks bar, extensions, etc.
3. **Multiple Angles**: Capture different states (default, hover, active)
4. **Context**: Include surrounding elements for spacing reference
5. **Mobile**: Use browser dev tools to capture responsive views
