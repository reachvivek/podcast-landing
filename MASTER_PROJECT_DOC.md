**This is a STUDIO BOOKING website, NOT a podcast listening platform**

**What Client Does:**

❌ Host podcast episodes for streaming
❌ Operate as podcast network

### Target Audience
- Podcast creators (not listeners)
- Content creators & influencers
- Businesses & corporations
- Authors & speakers
- Media professionals

### Primary CTA
**"BOOK STUDIOS & SERVICES"** (everywhere on site)

### Key Messaging Changes from Template

| Template (Podover) | TSUROV Site |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "Listen Now" | "Book Now" |
| "Subscribe" | "Get a Quote" |
| "Latest Episodes" | "Recent Projects" / "Client Showcase" |
| "Play Episode" | "View Project" |
| "Our Podcasts" | "Our Work" / "Portfolio" |
| "Donate Us" | ❌ REMOVE |
